The extension allows for ease of taking math notes and otherwise generating images of equations through the intuitive equation-writing of MathQuill, the same API that the graphing website https://www.desmos.com is based on.
After entering the desired equation, the generated image can be click-dragged out of the extension and into a Google Doc or other online word-processor that supports images, as well as copying the image or its address to use elsewhere.

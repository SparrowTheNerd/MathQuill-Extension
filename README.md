This extension utilizes the MathQuill API (https://github.com/mathquill/mathquill) as permitted by the Mozilla Public License 2.0 distributable open-source license which MathQuill has been applied to.

The extension allows for ease of taking math notes and otherwise generating images of equations through the intuitive equation-writing of MathQuill, the same API that the graphing website https://www.desmos.com is based on.
After entering the desired equation, the generated image can be click-dragged out of the extension and into a Google Doc or other online word-processor that supports images, as well as copying the image or its address to use elsewhere.
